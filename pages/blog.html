                            <p>New babies all look pretty much the same. That's what I thought before any of this fatherhood stuff arrived, I still think that to a degree, but I'm starting to appreciate the little things that distinguish them all from each other and Winston Churchill...</p>
                            <p>That, dear reader, is because we've just had a 3D scan.</p>
                            <p>These scans, if you haven't already come across one, use a more advanced machine that can read reflections of various frequencies simultaneously, building layers of images to produce an image that includes some depth perception. Add in some clever image processing and careful operation by the technician, and you avoid creepy skull cross-sections to produce a 3D image of your unborn child. Clever stuff.
                            </p>

                            <p>Expensive stuff, too, and we weren't sure whether it would really be worth it. Now that I've actually seen my son though, I would definitely recommend it.</p>
                            <p>Initially little Sharky was doing his sharky thing and thrashing around, but always managing to stay face-down. Save for a brief glimpse under an arm and through a loop of umbilical, the only face-like view we got was of an (adorable, admittedly) ear.</p>
                            <p>The company we went with, <a href="http://www.ultrasound-direct.com/" style="padding-right: 18px; background: transparent url(../img/common/new_window.gif) no-repeat center right;"target="_blank">Baby Bond</a> were great. After a fair while chasing the little monster around, they suggested we go for a wander before trying again. Attempt number 2 was no more successful, Sharky was now facing up, but his arms remained stubbornly crossed over his face. To be fair, I'd be in the same boxing-pose if someone kept jabbing a plastic thing at my head.</p>
                            <p>We actually ended up having some coffee while the next couple went in for their appointment before going back in for a third try. Given our session was only meant to last half an hour, I was very impressed. Sharky obliged by showing his face too, which was amazing. Incredible that we can see so much detail before he even arrives.</p>
                            <p>More importantly, he's inherited my nose, not my father-in-law's. Now that's a profile you could put on currency.</p>

                            <p>We've decided to go to the <a href="https://www.nct.org.uk/courses" style="padding-right: 18px; background: transparent url(../img/common/new_window.gif) no-repeat center right;"target="_blank">NCT</a> courses based on advice from someone who's recently had a youngling.

                            Lets face it, no matter how good your friends are, they're going to get tired of all your talk of nappies and crap pretty quickly so having some other sleep-deprived parent-zombies to relate to is definitely a good thing.

                            <p>Turns out American sit-coms aren't a good thing on which to base your expectations of pregnancy. Funny, that...
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            After we had a positive pregnancy test or three (the first pair were from Wilko's, we had to double-check with an expensive one), we figured a trip to the maternity clinic to confirm the pregnancy was the done thing. That's how it is in Friends, after all. As it happens, those sticks are so reliable that it's not worth a checkup, at least when the NHS is paying.</p>

                            <p>You don't actually get an appointment until 8 weeks into the preganancy, which feels like a long time to go un-advised when this fairly life-changing event is beginning. You don't really tell people until much later on in the little one's development so you can't get advice from people who've done this all before.
                            <br />
                            That in itself is a little odd. In that first few weeks we were both going through the excitement, trepidation and whatnot of getting the news while, all our nearest and dearest were oblivious. When it does come round to the big reveal to the family, you've pretty much got your head around things but they're all in that initial 'whoah...' phase.
                            <br />
                            <br />I say I've got my head around it, but every so often it dawns on me that by the new year, a little person will be here that's entirely dependant on my wife and I. 
                            <br />
                            <br />Actually, that's pretty scary...</p>
