## RaisingSharky
### A light-hearted parenting blog from a first-time father.
----
Initially created as a way to learn the basics of web design, from HTML & CSS to JavaScript, it's now become a blog that I actually want to maintain.

I've learned a lot by looking at other people's code, so below is a list of all the sources I've used and links to any snippets I've incorporated into the site:
  * Yahoo! PureCSS http://github.com/yahoo/pure/
    * Initially a direct copy of the blog example, my site in its current state is a heavily altered version of their CSS & HTML.
    * They ask that anyone using their code also include a copy of their licence: http://raisingsharky.github.io/RaisingSharky/download/licence.md
  * Felix Hagspiel's lightbox https://github.com/felixhagspiel/jsOnlyLightbox
    * I needed an image lightbox, and this one was really well explained & easy to implement, thank you Mr Hagspiel.
  * Minimal Monkey's social buttons http://codepen.io/minimalmonkey/pen/Ecpla
    * My home-made image-based ones were ugly. Until I learn to make ones as good as these, they'll remain part of the site.
  * Cookie consent https://github.com/dobarkod/cookie-banner/
    * Again, quite heavily customised, but I'd never have got something like this working without help.

Since I wouldn't have even got this far without other people's open source code, please feel free to copy, alter and re-use any of mine. Just remember to honour the licence requests etc. of the third party bits I've used.
